# Global Settings

The Global Settings define the foundational behavior, identity, and boundaries of your **Smart AI**. These settings apply across the entire conversation, ensuring your **Voice AI Agents for Indian Languages** and **Voice AI Agents for Arabic** remain consistent and professional throughout the call.

## Configuration Steps

<Steps>
	<Step title="Define AI Agent Persona">
		The Persona is the core identity of your **Voice AI Agent**. It dictates the tone, style, and vocabulary used by the Agent. 
		* **Tone & Style:** Specify if the agent should be formal, empathetic, or enthusiastic.
		* **Linguistic Nuance:** When building AI Agents specialized in regional langiages, define the dialect preference. Ex. If building **Voice AI Agents for Arabic**, define if the Agent should use Modern Standard Arabic or a specific regional dialect (e.g., Emirati or Egyptian).
		* **Cultural Language Context:** For **Voice AI Agents for Indian Languages** or any other code-switched language, you can instruct the agent to use code-switch (e.g., using "Hinglish") to sound more natural to the caller.
	</Step>

	<Step title="Set AI Agent Confines">
		Confines act as the "guardrails" for your AI Agents. This ensures the Agent stays on topic and does not discuss restricted subjects.
		* **Knowledge Boundary:** Restrict the agent to only use the information provided in your Recipe.
		* **Behavioral Constraints:** Prevent the agent from mentioning competitors or making unauthorized financial commitments.
		* **Safety:** Essential for **Voice AI Agents** in sensitive sectors like healthcare or finance to ensure compliance and data privacy.
	</Step>

	<Step title="Configure Voicemail Behaviour">
		Determine how your **Voice AI Agent** should behave when it encounters an answering machine or voicemail system.
		* **Disconnect:** The agent will automatically hang up if a voicemail is detected, optimizing costs.
		* **Leave a Message:** If selected, you can provide a specific script. For example: *"Hello, this is the Verloop Assistant calling. I'm sorry I missed you, I will try calling back later."*
		* **Multi-lingual Support:** You can define different messages for your **Voice AI Agents for Arabic** or **Voice AI Agents for Indian Languages** to ensure the recorded message matches the recipient's preferred language.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Impact on Conversation Flow

Global settings provide the "vibe" and ruleset that individual blocks inherit. While a specific block might handle a specialized task like "Booking a Room," the **AI Agent Persona** ensures the way the room is booked feels consistent with the start of the call. 

By properly configuring these settings, your Voice AI Agents become more than just scripts - they become intelligent, localized representatives of your brand.
