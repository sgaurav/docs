title: 'Condition Block'
description: 'Route conversations based on deterministic logic and variable comparisons.'

The **Condition Block** acts as the logic gate of your Voice AI Agent recipe. It evaluates specific variables against defined criteria and routes the conversation workflow accordingly.

This block is essential for scenarios where the conversation path depends on hard data rather than fuzzy user conversation. For example, a refund process might differ significantly based on the transaction amount, user loyalty tier, and product category.

<Note>
  **Rule of Thumb: Condition vs. SmartAI**
  * **Use Condition Block:** When you have clear, rule-based logic (e.g., "If `amount` > 500 AND `user` is 'Gold'"). It is faster and error-proof.
  * **Use SmartAI/Ask Block Routing:** When you need to route based on vague user intent or sentiment (e.g., "If the user seems angry").

## How it Works

The Condition Block executes logic similar to `if / else-if / else` statements in programming. It evaluates rules top-to-bottom and follows the path of the first matching condition.

### 1. Defining Conditions
To configure a logic rule:
1.  **Select a Variable:** Choose the variable you want to evaluate (e.g., `{{transaction_amount}}`).
2.  **Choose an Operator:** Select a comparison operator such as:
    * Equals / Not Equals
    * Less than / Greater than
    * Contains / Does not contain
    * Is Empty / Is Not Empty
    * Other conditions
3.  **Define the Value:** Compare the variable against:
    * **A Fixed Value:** (e.g., `500`, `active`, `refund`)
    * **Another Variable:** (e.g., `{{account_balance}}`)

### 2. Complex Logic (Nesting & Chaining)
You can handle sophisticated scenarios by layering your logic:

* **AND/OR Logic:** Combine multiple criteria within a single branch (e.g., "If `Region` is 'US' **AND** `Status` is 'Active'").
* **Else-If Structure:** Add multiple distinct conditions to the block. The system checks them sequentially.
    * *Condition 1:* Is User VIP? -> Route to VIP Flow.
    * *Condition 2:* Is User New? -> Route to Onboarding Flow.

### 3. The "Else" Fallback
Every Condition Block includes a default **Else** path. If none of the defined conditions are met, the workflow automatically follows this connection
