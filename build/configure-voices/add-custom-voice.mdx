## How to Add a New Voice

Follow these steps to expand your speech library with custom profiles.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Access Speech Profiles">
		Navigate to **Settings > Voice > Speech Profiles** and click the **+ Add your speech** button in the top right corner.
	</Step>

	<Step title="Define the Profile Identity">
		In the "Add new speech" modal, provide the foundational details for your agent:
		* **Speech name & Description:** Give your voice a recognizable name and a brief description of its intended use (e.g., "Customer Support - Arabic").
		* **Language & Accent:** Specify the primary language and regional accent to optimize the Voice Agent's performance for local callers.
		* **Gender & Tags:** Select the gender (Male or Female) and add searchable tags to help your team find the voice later.
	</Step>

	<Step title="Configure Provider Setup">
		Connect the profile to your preferred backend engine:
		* **Provider:** Select from our list of supported providers like Azure, ElevenLabs, or Google.
		* **Voice Name:** Enter the specific voice identifier provided by the TTS engine.
	</Step>

	<Step title="Preview and Save">
		Use the **Play sample** button to audition the voice directly within the dashboard. Once you are satisfied that the tone matches your brand—whether it's a friendly **Hinglish** persona or a formal **Arabic Accent AI Agent**—click **Add speech**.
