# Word Management & Pronunciation

Ensure your **Voice Agent** sounds like a local expert by fine-tuning how it pronounces brand names, industry jargon, or regional slang. **Word Management** allows you to define phonetic spellings to improve voice accuracy across all your **Voice AI Agents**.

This feature is especially powerful when building **Automated Phone Call Agents for Indian Languages** and **Arabic Voice Agents**, where specific names, currencies, or localized terms (like "Lakhs" or "Humein") require precise phonetic guidance to sound natural.

## Defining Custom Pronunciations

The Pronunciation library acts as a custom dictionary for your Voice Agents. By mapping a written word to its phonetic equivalent, you ensure the agent never trips over complex or non-standard terms.

### Common Use Cases
* **Currency & Units:** Ensure **Voice AI Agents for Indian Languages** correctly pronounce "INR" as "rupees" or "lacs" as "lakhs" instead of literal phonetic spellings.
* **Regional Nuances:** Map local terms like "Humein" to "Hamey" to ensure the Voice Agent captures the correct natural inflection.
* **Brand Names:** Teach your **Arabic Accent AI Agents** the exact way to say your company name if it follows a non-standard pronunciation.
