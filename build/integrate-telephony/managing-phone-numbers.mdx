To bring your **Voice Agents** to life, you must connect them to a telephony provider. This section covers how to add phone numbers, link them to specific Recipes, and configure advanced call behavior for your Voice Agents.

## Adding a Phone Number

You can integrate your existing telephony infrastructure to route calls through Verloop's **Voice Agents**.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Initiate Setup">
		Navigate to **Settings > Voice > Phone Numbers** and click the **+ Add another number** button.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Phone Setup">
		Link your physical number to a conversational flow:
		* **Phone Number:** Select your country code and enter the full phone number.
		* **Recipe:** Select the specific Recipe (Conversation Flow) that this number should trigger. This allows you to have dedicated lines for specialized Voice Agents.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Telephony Provider Setup">
		Select your preferred provider and enter the required credentials from your provider's dashboard:

		| Provider | Required Credentials |
		| :--- | :--- |
		| **Twilio** | Account SID, Auth Token |
		| **Exotel** | Account SID, API Key, API Token, Outbound App Id, Sub Domain |
		| **Knowlarity** | API Token, API Key, Plan Id, Plan Name, Sound Id |
		| **Verloop.io** | Use Verloop's native telephony stack. |
	</Step>
	<Step title="Speech Recognition & Voice">
		Fine-tune how the Voice Agent listens and Automate Phone Calls on this specific line:
		* **Language:** Select the primary language for speech-to-text processing.
		* **Boosted Keywords:** Enter specific words (like brand names or industry terms) to increase recognition accuracy. This is highly recommended for **Hinglish** and specialized **Arabic Accent AI Agents**.
		* **Voice Setup:** Choose the default **Speech Profile** for this number.
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Call Configurations

Manage the lifecycle of a call to optimize costs and improve user experience through the **Other configurations** section.

### End Call on Silence
This setting determines the time from the last message from the user when the system will force close the call.
* **Range:** **1 minute** up to **5 minutes**.
* **Best Practice:** For **Voice Agents for Banking**, a slightly longer silence threshold can accommodate natural pauses(when user might be searching for documents) in conversation.

### Max call duration with AI
To prevent runaway costs or stuck sessions, set a hard limit on the longest a phone call will be allowed to go on before forced disconnection.
* **Range:** **5 minutes** up to **30 minutes**.
* **Usage:** For complex support flows using Voice Agents, a 10-15 minute limit is typically sufficient.
* **Best Practice:** For **Voice Agents for Marketing** and **Voice Agents for Outbound Calling**, in our experience calls do not go past 2-3 minutes.
