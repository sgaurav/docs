## Post-Call Insights

Unlock the full potential of your **Voice Agents** by automating the quality assurance and data extraction process.

Post-Call Insights eliminates the need for manual listening by using AI to analyze transcripts immediately after a call ends. Whether you need to verify if a loan interest was expressed, check if a specific "Hinglish" phrase was used, or summarize a 10-minute support call, this feature delivers structured data in near real-time.

## How It Works

1.  **Define Parameters:** You set up specific questions or data points you want the AI to extract (e.g., "Did the customer agree to the appointment?").
2.  **Automated Processing:** As soon as the call ends, our **AI Engine** processes the transcript.
3.  **Data Delivery:** The structured results are pushed to your Webhook, API, and Dashboard within seconds.
