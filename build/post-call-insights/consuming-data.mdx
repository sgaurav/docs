# Viewing & Using Data

Once your **Voice AI Agents** have finished the call and information is processed, the data is available through three primary channels. Insight is typically completed within seconds but may take up to 5 minutes after the call ending.

## 1. Dashboard & Transcript View

For manual review, you can see the analysis side-by-side with the call transcript.

* Navigate to the **Conversation Screen**.
* Look for the **Post-Call Insights** widget.
* **Status:** You may see "Analyzing Your Call..." immediately after hang-up. Once done, the values (e.g., `Sentiment: Positive`) will appear.

## 2. Real-Time Webhooks

For CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho), use Webhooks to push data instantly.

The webhook event `analysis_success` will contain a payload similar to this:

```json
{
  "trigger_type": "analysis_success",
  "channel": "voice",
  "room": {
    "analysis": {
      "user_defined": {
        "interest_in_loan": "true",
        "lead_status": "Qualified",
        "call_summary": "Customer is interested in 5 Lakh loan for home renovation."
      }
    }
  }
}

## 3. Reporting & API

All analysis parameters are automatically added as columns in your **Master Report** downloads (headers will look like analysis.interest_in_loan).
