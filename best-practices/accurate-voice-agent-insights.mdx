## Optimization Guide

To get the most accurate results from your Voice Agents, follow these prompt engineering best practices.

## Dos and Don'ts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DO: Be Specific in Descriptions">
    The "Description" field is effectively a prompt for the LLM.
    * **Bad:** "Check interest."
    * **Good:** "Did the user explicitly state they want to buy the insurance policy? Mark as `True` only if they said 'Yes' or 'Agree'."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DO: Handle Ambiguity in Enums">
    When using **Enum** (Select from List), ensure your options cover all scenarios.
    * **Recommended:** Always include an option like `"Unclear"` or `"Other"` so the AI isn't forced to make a wrong guess if the user was vague.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DON'T: Overload the Description">
    Keep descriptions under **300 characters**. If you need complex logic, split it into two separate parameters (e.g., one for "Interest" and one for "Reason").
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Latency

Analysis is evoked immediately but takes time to process.
* **Expectation:** Data is usually ready within seconds but may take up to 5 minutes post-call.
* **Workflow:** Do not block your immediate post-call logic (like sending an SMS) on the analysis result. Use the **Webhook** to trigger a separate follow-up flow once the data arrives.

## Regional Nuances

For **Voice AI Agents for Arabic** or Indian regions, the transcription might contain mixed languages.
* **Tip:** If you are analyzing a **Hinglish** call, you don't need to translate the description into Hindi. The AI understands the context of the transcript even if the prompt is in English.
* **Tip:** For **Arabic**, ensure your description asks for the *intent* rather than looking for specific keywords, as dialects (Khaleeji vs. Levantine) use different words for the same action.
