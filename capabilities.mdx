It supports diverse accents, handles background noise, and adapts to varying speech speeds, ensuring no detail is missed. A few things that set us apart

1. **Ultra-low Latency**: One of the fastest transcription engines for delivering human-like conversations.

2. **Noise Cancellation**: Filters out background noise to focus on the speakerâ€™s voice and deliver high-quality transcription even in most challenging environments.

3. **Multi-lingual**: Capable of handling 80+ globally spoken languages with a low Word Error Rate.

4. **Accent Adaptation**: Trained on datasets from around the world to understand regional variations.

5. **Contextually Aware**: Goes beyond literal transcription to interpret text accurately.

## Agentic LLM for Voice

In the world of voice AI agents, speed, and intelligence go hand in hand.&#x20;

At Verloop, we leverage a best-in-class, **purpose-trained** Large Language Model (LLM)**** that is specifically optimized for telephony automation. This not only ensures low-latency responses but those are also highly accurate, empathetic, and context-aware.

#### **Purpose-Trained Agentic AI**

Our LLM is meticulously trained on vast datasets of real-world conversational data, ensuring it understands nuances, idioms, and industry-specific terminology.&#x20;
