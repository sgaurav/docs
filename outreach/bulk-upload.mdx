# Creating a Voice Campaign (Excel)

The Excel upload method is ideal for one-off blasts or daily scheduled lists. Follow this 5-step wizard to launch your campaign.

## Step 1: Details

Navigate to **Outreach > + New Outreach** and configure the basics:
* **Name:** Give your campaign a recognizable name (e.g., "Deepavali Sale - Lead Qual").
* **Channel:** Select **Voice**.
* **Voice Integration:** Choose the specific phone number/line you want these calls to originate from.
* **Trigger:** Select **Via Excel**.

## Step 2: Bot Recipe

Link the campaign to a specific **Voice AI Agent**.
* **Select Recipe:** Choose the flow designed for this campaign (e.g., "Lead Qual Flow v2").
* **Start Recipe Logic:**
    * **Start Immediately:** AI speaks as soon as the call connects.
    * **Wait for User Greeting:** AI waits for the user to say "Hello" (Recommended for smoother UX).
    * **Wait for X seconds:** Adds a fixed delay (1-5s) before speaking.

## Step 3: Audience

Upload your target list.
* **File Format:** Upload your `.xls` or `.csv` file containing phone numbers and any custom variables (like `Name`, `DueAmount`) needed for the Recipe.
* **Skip Duplicates:** Enabled by default to prevent spamming the same number twice in one campaign.

## Step 4: Telephony Settings

Optimize your connection rates with smart dialing rules.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DND (Do Not Call) Hours">
    Define the quiet hours (e.g., 9 PM to 9 AM).
    * **Action:** Choose to **Discard** calls that fall in this window or **Schedule for later**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ring Duration">
    Set how long to ring before giving up (15s, 20s, 30s). [cite_start]Shorter durations reduce voicemail hits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Retry Logic">
    * **Max Retries:** Set between 0-10 attempts. 
    * **Retry Interval:** Define the wait time between retries (e.g., 2 hours). 
    * **Scenarios:** Select which outcomes trigger a retry (e.g., *Busy*, *No Answer*, *Failed*).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 5: Publish

Review your settings and click **Publish**. The system will begin dialing according to your schedule.
