# Creating a Voice Campaign (API)

The **Via API** trigger allows you to configure all the telephony rules (DND, Retries, AI behavior) within the dashboard, while managing the audience dynamically through your code. This is essential for event-based calling (e.g., calling a lead immediately after a form signup).

## Configuration Steps

Follow this guide to set up the campaign shell.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Campaign Details">
    Navigate to **Outreach > + New Outreach** and configure the foundational settings:
    * **Name:** Enter a unique identifier for your campaign.
    * **Channel:** Select **Voice**.
    * **Voice Integration:** Choose the phone number that will make the calls.
    * **Trigger:** Select **Via API**.
    
    <Note>
      Selecting **Via API** changes the workflow to accept single contact triggers rather than a bulk file upload.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Recipe Configuration">
    Define how the **Voice AI Agent** behaves once the call connects:
    * **Select Recipe:** Choose the specific voice flow for this campaign.
    * **Start Logic:** Determine when the AI speaks:
        * **Start Immediately:** The agent speaks the moment the call is answered.
        * **Wait for User Greeting:** The agent waits for the user to say "Hello" (uses Voice Activity Detection).
        * **Wait for X seconds:** Adds a configurable delay (1-5 seconds) before speaking.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Telephony Rules">
    Since API calls happen in real-time, these guardrails are critical to ensure compliance and high connection rates.

    * **DND Hours:** Define "Do Not Call" windows (e.g., 9 PM - 9 AM).
      * *Action:* Configure the system to either **Discard** the call or **Schedule for later** if triggered during DND.
    
    * **Ring Duration:** Set the maximum ring time (15-30 seconds) to avoid voicemail boxes.

    * **Retry Strategy:**
      * **Max Retries:** Set attempts from 0 to 10.
      * **Retry Interval:** Define the time gap between retries (e.g., 1 Hour).
      * **Scenarios:** Choose which outcomes trigger a retry (e.g., **Busy**, **No-answer**, **Failed**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Publish">
    Review your settings and click **Publish**. Your campaign is now active and listening for API requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Developer Integration

Once published, use the **Campaign ID** from the dashboard to trigger calls.

<Info>
  **API Triggering:**
  Your backend systems can now hit the Verloop Outreach Endpoint with the `campaign_id` and the specific user details (Phone Number, Custom Variables). The system will automatically apply the DND, Retry, and Recipe logic defined in the steps above.
