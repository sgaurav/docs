Verloop Voice AI Agents leverage modern telephony protocols and technologies to seamlessly bridge traditional voice networks with digital voice intelligence.

This section explains the fundamental mechanisms of telephony, key technical concepts, and the integration methods available for your deployment.

## How Telephony Works

Telephony enables the transmission of voice communications over distances by converting sound into electrical signals, transporting these signals over a network, and then converting them back to sound at the destination. A few key steps are listed below

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call Flow">
    A typical voice call begins when a user initiates a call via a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or VoIP endpoint. The call is then routed through various network components until it reaches your Voice AI platform.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Signal Conversion">
    When a call is initiated, analog audio signals are converted to digital data using codecs. This digital data is packetized and transmitted over IP networks. At the receiving end, the packets are reassembled, and digital-to-analog conversion takes place to reproduce the sound.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Real-Time Communication">
    For both inbound and outbound calls, a real-time, bi-directional communication channel is established between the caller and the Verloop Voice AI. This channel is maintained using robust protocols that ensure low latency and high call quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Traditional telephony uses the **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)** to transmit voice signals over physical phone lines.  Digital telephony converts these signals into data packets for transmission over IP networks (VoIP).

### Call Flow

A typical voice call begins when a user initiates a call via a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or VoIP endpoint. The call is then routed through various network components until it reaches the receiver and in your case, Verloop's Voice AI platform.

### Signal Conversion

When a call is initiated, analog audio signals are converted to digital data using codecs. This digital data is packetized and transmitted over IP networks.&#x20;

At the receiving end, the packets are reassembled, and digital-to-analog conversion takes place to reproduce the sound.

### Real-Time Communication

For both inbound and outbound calls, a real-time, bi-directional communication channel is established between the caller and the Verloop Voice AI. This channel is maintained using robust protocols that ensure low latency and high call quality.

## Key Concepts

Understanding telephony integrations requires familiarity with several technical terms:

1. **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)** - A signaling protocol used to establish, maintain, and terminate communication sessions over IP networks, including voice and video calls. Think of it as the language your phone system uses to talk to Verloop.io.

2. **PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)** - The PSTN is the traditional circuit-switched telephone network used worldwide. It forms the backbone for conventional voice communications and connects with VoIP systems via gateways.

3. **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** - Web sockets offer a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. This persistent connection is crucial for real-time applications such as call control, signaling, and media exchange in web-based integrations.

4. **Trunk** - A virtual connection that carries multiple communication channels. In the context of SIP, a SIP trunk connects your phone system to Verloop.io.

5. **Additional Concepts**&#x20;

   1. **Codecs** - Algorithms that compress and decompress digital audio, ensuring efficient data transmission.

   2. **Media Gateways** - Devices or software that translate media streams between different telephony protocols.

   3. **Signaling Protocols** - Standards that manage the setup, control, and teardown of calls.

## Available Integration Methods
