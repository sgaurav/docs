## Testing Your Voice AI Agent

Before deploying your **Voice AI Agents** to live customers, it is critical to validate their behavior across three dimensions: conversational logic, speech recognition accuracy, and Voice Agent conversational quality.

Verloop provides a tiered testing suite designed to take you from initial prompt engineering to real-world telephony simulation.

## Testing Methods

  <Card title="Manual Chat" icon="message-bot" href="/test-voice-agent/manual-chat">
    **Best for:** Logic & Flow.
    Test your Voice Agent prompts and state transitions instantly via text. View raw **LLM logs** and debug variable extraction without speaking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Call" icon="globe" href="/test-voice-agent/web-call">
    **Best for:** ASR & Pronunciation.
    Simulate a voice call directly in your browser. Perfect for testing accents and language nuances like **Voice AI Agents for Indian Languages** and code-switching capabilities like Hinglish recognition without incurring telephony costs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phone Call" icon="phone" href="/test-voice-agent/phone-call">
    **Best for:** Real-world Latency.
    Dial your integrated phone number to experience the agent over actual telecom networks. Essential for final Quality Assurance before go-live.
