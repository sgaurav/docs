## Manual Chat Simulator

The Chat Simulator is your primary workspace for building logic. It strips away the voice layer, allowing you to focus purely on how the **AI Agent** reasons and responds.

## How to Test
1. Open your Recipe in the **Recipe Builder**.
2. Click the **Play Icon** in the top navigation bar.
3. Select **Test as Webchat**.
4. Type messages as if you were the user.

## The Debug Mode

The **Debug Mode** panel is the "black box" recorder for your AI. It reveals exactly what the **LLM** is thinking.

### Key Debug Sections

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="System & Instructions">
    Shows the exact prompt injected into the LLM, including your **Agent Persona** and **Agent Confines**.
    * *Usage:* If the agent is being too casual, check if the "Persona" block was correctly loaded here.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Variable Capture">
    Displays data extracted from the user's input (e.g., `user.city = "Frankfurt"`).
    * *Usage:* Essential for Voice Agents, ensuring the agent correctly identifies entities even from complex sentence structures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response from LLM">
    The raw text generated by the model before any post-processing.
    * *Latency Metric:* Look for **Time taken** (e.g., `1168 ms`). This helps you optimize your prompt length for faster responses.
  </Accordion>

**Pro Tip:** Use the "Restart Chat" button frequently to clear context and test fresh conversation starts.
