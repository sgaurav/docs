Web Call testing bridges the gap between text chat and real telephony. It uses Verloop's web SDK to connect your browser's microphone directly to the **Voice AI Agent**, allowing you to test Speech-to-Text (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) performance without dialing a phone number.

## Initiating a Web Call

1. Click the **Play Icon** in the Recipe Builder.
2. Select **Test as Webcall**.
3. A configuration popup will appear.

## Configuration Options

You can configure the test in two ways:

### Option 1: Test from Phone Settings
Select an existing phone number from your account. The system will auto-populate the specific **Voice**, **Language**, and **Boosted Keywords** assigned to that line.
* *Best for:* Regression testing an existing live agent.

### Option 2: Custom Configuration
Manually tweak settings to experiment with new accents or languages.

* **Language:** Test how different models handle your script (e.g., switch between *English (India)* and *Hindi*).
* **Voice:** Audition different voices(e.g., *Arjun* vs. *Riya*) to see which tone fits your brand.
* **Boosted Keywords:** Add terms like "UPI" or "IBAN" to test if the ASR accuracy improves.

## Simulating Context (Request Data)

Real calls often come with data (Caller ID, CRM info). You can simulate this in Web Call:
* **Add Variable:** Click **+ Add More** in the test popup.
* **Key/Value:** Enter context like `customer_name: "Rahul"` or `account_type: "Gold"`.
* **Result:** The AI Agent will start the call knowing this context (e.g., *"Hello Rahul, thanks for being a Gold member"*).

## Debugging Web Calls

During the Web Call, the **Chat Interface** remains active.
* **Live Transcript:** Watch the ASR convert your speech to text in real-time.
* **Debug Logs:** If the agent misunderstands you, check the logs to see if it was a transcription error (ASR) or a logic error (LLM).

<Warning>
**Microphone Permissions:** Ensure your browser has permission to access your microphone. If the agent doesn't respond, check your browser's privacy settings.
