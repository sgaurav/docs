The final stage of validation is the "Real World" test. This involves dialing a phone number integrated with your Recipe to experience the **Voice AI Agent** exactly as a customer would.

## Prerequisites
* You must have a configured number in **Settings > Voice > Phone Numbers**.
* The number must be linked to the Recipe you are testing.
* You need a valid provider integration (Twilio, Exotel, etc.).

## What to Test

### 1. Network Latency
WebRTC (Web Call) is often faster than standard telephony. A real call helps you verify if the **Turn-Taking** speed is acceptable over 4G/5G networks.

### 2. Background Noise
Call from a noisy environment (street, cafe) to test the agent's **Interruption Sensitivity**.
* *Adjustment:* If the agent gets interrupted too easily by noise, go to your Phone Number settings and increase the **Silence Threshold**.

### 3. Dialect Handling on Phone Lines
Phone lines compress audio, which can affect accent recognition.
* **Voice AI Agents for Arabic:** Ensure the distinction between *Khaleeji* and *Levantine* accents holds up over the phone line.
* **Hinglish:** Verify that rapid code-switching is captured accurately despite the lower audio fidelity of standard telephony.

## Analyzing the Call

Since you cannot see live logs during a real phone call:
1. Complete the conversation and hang up.
2. Navigate to the **Conversations** tab in your dashboard.
3. Open the transcript for the call you just made.
4. Review the **Post-Call Insights** and transcript to identify any drop-offs.
